A song for the dead, from the Deep Mani

*Mani is the barren and lonely landscape at the southwestern tip of the middle leg of the Peloponnesus, Greece's great peninsula, and the setting for [Isolation](http://www.imby.net/20190811/isolation). This second novelette in the [Abrasion](http://www.imby.net/20170525/abrasion) series explores our need for human connection and the unique reasons why, for a couple of characters who share the stage at a critical moment in history, this need goes painfully unmet.*

*I created this poem in the style of the* mirologia, *a mourning song for the dead unique to Mani. It represents a key character's devotion to a old priest that welcomed him when few others would have. The short poem draws on imagery from the tradition -- where for example, a* cyprus tree *will often represent the deceased -- and also draws inspiration from the physical spaces the main character haunts -- the* ruined church) *to highlight the aging and infirm priest himself (with his* quaking dome). *The rhyme scheme is A-B-C-D--D-C-B-A* ....

O Cyprus Tree of deepest root,  
O flow of holy water!  
Thy ruined church  
(with quaking dome)  
yet bore a beaming welcome  
to thy warm and humble hutch;  
to host a prideful sinner,  
to cleanse of direst soot.
