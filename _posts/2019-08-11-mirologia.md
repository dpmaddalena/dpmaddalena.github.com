## A Mirologia

*A song of the dead, from the Deep Mani*

Mani is the barren and lonely landscape of the southwestern tip of the middle leg of the Peloponnesus, 
Greece's western peninsula. It is the setting for [Isolation](http://www.imby.net/20190811/isolation), the second 
novelette in the [Abrasion](http://www.imby.net/20170525/abrasion) series, which explores our 
need for human contact, and the many reasons why this need so often goes unmet.

I created this poem in the style of the mirologia, a mourning song for the dead unique to Mani, to appear 
in a key character's written devotion to a old priest that took him in. The short poem contains a number of images from the 
greater story, drawing on imagery of the traditional mirologia (a *cyprus tree* will represent the deceased), and of 
the physical spaces the main character haunts (the *ruined church*) to highlight the aging 
and infirm priest himself (eg, '... *quaking dome*'). The rhyme scheme is A-B-C-D--D-C-B-A ....

O Cyprus Tree of deepest root,  
O flow of holy water!  
Thy ruined church  
(with quaking dome)  
yet bore a beaming welcome  
to thy warm and humble hutch;  
to host a prideful sinner,  
to cleanse of direst soot.
