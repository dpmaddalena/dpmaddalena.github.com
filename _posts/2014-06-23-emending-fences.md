Today, in a dream,  
I saw a thing so far  
denied to me.   
That between my neighbor’s  
and my home, there  
would only be the shadow  
and the dark at night,  
and after sunrise  
only questions about what might  
bring us together. Now my eyes  
have seen the dusky pathway   
through the green&mdash;misty, wide, and lit  
by lantern-yellow beams  
in the friendly trees&mdash;I miss it.   

Then, woods lie open: no fence  
or line is needed, to remind  
where my neighbor’s premise ends,  
or to protect what’s mine.
