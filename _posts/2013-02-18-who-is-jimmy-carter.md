It is useless, but I try  
To escape the repetitive  
Dream, wherein a number  
Of Russian teens,  
In a secondary school  
In Borisoglebsk  
Learning HyperText Markup  
Language and other disconnected,  
Technical, exports of the west,  
Ask WHO IS JIMMY CARTER,  
And struggle to sort out the mysteries  
Of a world that will never  
Stop growing more complex.
