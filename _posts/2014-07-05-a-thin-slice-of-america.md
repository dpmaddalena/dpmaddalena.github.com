Our hostess serves me up  
a thin slice of America—  
sugar-spangled platter, blocks  
of color: blue, red, and white  
approximating our country’s  
flag, when you look at it right.  
She made it backwards, but  
the effect is the same:    
colour-coded reassurance—   
that our revels make no claim   
to personal fame or ill-timed  
declarations of independence.
