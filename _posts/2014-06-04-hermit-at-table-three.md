The silence of porcelain,  
clink! like a prayer bell;  
a cluttered space is cleared—.  
for silent prayer and mindful  
noticing—of nothing.  

The monk today  
is metropolitan,  
an overseer of cafe tables,  
ensconced in blackboard caverns,  
afloat in a holy see;  

who moves with and against  
the baggage, some that floats,  
to dissolve in the air and light,  
and some, sinking and unfathomable  
mystery in the coffee-black  
and deathly-silent deeps.
