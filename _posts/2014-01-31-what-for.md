##What For?

The story concerns mainly Ethan Allen Hawley, a former member of Long Island's aristocratic class. 
Ethan's late father has lost his family's fortune, and, consequently, Ethan now works as a clerk in 
a grocery store. His wife Mary and children resent their mediocre social and economic status, and 
do not value the honesty and integrity that Ethan struggles to maintain in a corrupt society. These 
external factors, as well as his own psychological turmoil, cause Ethan to attempt to neglect his 
normal standards of integrity in order to reclaim the status and wealth that he once enjoyed.
