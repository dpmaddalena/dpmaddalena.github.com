Haiku is a form of poetry that appeals to me in significant and growing ways: they are the right size for an impatient poet; they have strict formal requirements* within which the writer has complete freedom of subject and word-choice; they align with my current professional goal of saying meaningful things very efficiently and in a very small space. *While haiku don't have to follow any rules to be good, and there's no consensus on how to translate ancient rules of haiku into English, I decided to follow a strict, traditional, western syllable limit for the poems, that is 5-7-5.*

These are the best of a recent prolific period. After writing a few poems a year for years, I recently picked up a paper notebook, and wrote 30 haiku in about 20 days. 

### Haiku Divina

*making the poetry of scripture my own, an exercise in lectio divina*

Seven poems--four from Isaiah 1; one each from Romans 9, Song 8, Matthew 11

Solemnity is \
The costume iniquity \
Is wearing to church.

Spread your hands in prayer --  \
I hide my eyes from you -- there: \
blood has stained your palm.

You will be like wool, \
if you agree and obey; \
grass-fed and content.



### Miscellaneous

the end of simpler \
times: see the learned man pass \
through the garden gate

To be powerless, \
Led by the hand -- bad enough! \
Yet, reckoned a child?
