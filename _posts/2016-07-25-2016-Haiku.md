Haiku is a form of poetry that appeals to me in significant and growing ways: they are the right size for an impatient poet; they have strict formal requirements within which the writer has complete freedom of subject and word-choice; they align with my current professional goal of saying significant things very efficiently and in a very small space.

This slide show contains the best of a recent prolific period. After writing a few poems a year for years, I picked up a paper notebook recently, and wrote 30 haiku in about 20 days.
