The *Lost World Ambivid* is sample of a video project created from the 1925 silent film adaption of Arthur Conan Doyle's novel, that is itself the inspiration for *King Kong*.

The project is part of a series I'm calling *ambivids*, or ambient videos, silent video art meant to be displayed behind live or recorded music to add a dimension to a listening experience. This sampler was created after watching the full length video while listening to Radiohead's *Kid A*, and stumbling onto this pairing of song to images. I've also created full length ambivids from *Nosferatu* and *Voyage to The Prehistoric Planet*.

- **Images**: the black and white silent film, *The Lost World*, was stressed with various forced-color and contrast settings in Blender, then doubled and de-synced to create serendipitous juxtopositions. 
- **Music**: *The National Anthem* by Radiohead
