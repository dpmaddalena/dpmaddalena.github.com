*Lost World* is selection from video project created from the 1925 silent film adaption of Arthur Conan Doyle's novel, that is itself the inspiration for *King Kong*.

The project is an ambient video, a selection from a film-length, silent background video meant to be displayed behind live or recorded music as an added dimension. This sampler was created after discovering a fun connection between the Radiohead song and this section of the film. 

- **Images**: the black and white film was stressed with various forced-color and contrast settings in Blender, then doubled and de-synced to create serendipitous juxtopositions. 
- **Music**: *The National Anthem* by Radiohead
