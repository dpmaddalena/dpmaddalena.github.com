A video collage about the way that time can erode our confidence in childhood stories.

The *young heroine* and the *bitter queen* are imagined to be two versions of the same person, whether separated by age or perspective. 

- **Images**: clips from a popular 1930s full-length animated movie about a princess, some little people, and her evil stepmother
- **Music**: *The Holograms* by Fol Chen

The repeating Lyrics of Fol Chen's funky-awesome song are: 

> First the words were good
They helped us understand
But then the sounds would double
Like holograms
