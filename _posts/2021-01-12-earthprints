synthesis: the reconciliation of the ideal and the real

If the beautiful, repeating patterns in nature are a *thesis* in the great story of the creator's grace and generosity (ask, 'why do we love what we see?'), then the asphalt that we have covered it with is *antithesis* â€” an offense to creation and beauty.

But beauty breaks through, the patterns repeat, and reassert themselves. In the cracks you can see along streets and sidewalks, there is a synthesis at work; of God's grace revealing beauty even in the clash between natural and artificial.

I call these revelations Earthprints: they are '[like a fingerprint /escaped the glove /the burglar wore to hide it](http://www.imby.net/20140125/earthprints)'.

Between the natural thesis and the artificial antithesis, a synthesis emerges, a new story.

Meditation

Has your own ideal of Who You Are been threatened by some reality? Have you seen the thesis of who you thought you were meant to be threatened by an antithetical story?

We learn from redemption history that God created a universe of good, with the will to share love with his creation. This is the thesis of our shared story. Our human response has been to reject the rule of love, imagining that we don't need what God is offering. Our response is antithetical to God's desires. God could have responded in a number of ways to this terrible situation, but chose generously to join divinity to humanity in Christ, a synthesis that bears witness to true grace and repairs the the schism between us.

Invite God to reveal to you how grace is at work bringing beauty to light in your life.

Watch for the synthesis as God reconciles the ideal and the real in your story.
