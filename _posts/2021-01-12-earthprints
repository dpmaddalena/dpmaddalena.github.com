synthesis: the reconciliation of the ideal and the real

There are beautiful, repeating patterns in nature--think whirlpools, fiddleheads, and galaxies ... think branches, river delta tributaries, amd our circulatory system. If these patterns are a kind of *thesis* in the great story of creation, one marked by a graceful and charming order, then our "civilized" response to all this--think asphalt over earth--is an *antithesis* â€” an offense all that goodness, a rebuke, a counter-argument.

But beauty breaks through, the patterns repeat, and reassert themselves. In the cracks you can see along streets and sidewalks, there is a synthesis at work; of a more powerful grace of redemption, even in the clash between natural and artificial.

I call these revelations, where I find them, Earthprints: they are '[like a fingerprint /escaped the glove /the burglar wore to hide it](https://www.dpmaddalena.com/20140125/earthprints)'. Where I find them is often scarred in the concrete that hides the ancient wilderness under my town. 

When the natural meets the artificial, when thesis meets antithesis, sometimes a synthesis emerges, a new story.

The history of my faith tells a similar story: that God created a universe of good, with the will to share love-in-relationship with the creatures of his making. This is the primary thesis of faith history. Our human response has been to reject the rule of love, imagining that we don't need what God is offering, that we will get love on our own terms. This response is antithetical to God's repeated invitations. God could have responded in a number of terrible ways to this terrible situation, but chooses generously to join divinity to humanity in Christ Jesus, a synthesis that bears witness to true grace and repairs the the schisms that burden humankind.
