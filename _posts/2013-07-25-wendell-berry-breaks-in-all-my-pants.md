##I

It's someone else's job to break  
in all my pants --  
some farmer or fashion model,  
who's hard at work someplace,  
living the active life I guess  
I don't have time for, anymore--I get  
soft slacks, sensitively sewn, to cover  
the shame of my naked, useless legs,  
and fulfill the promise of a technological age,  
while projecting an air  
of good times and hard wear.  

I dreamed it could be Wendell Berry,  
whom I'm certain never buys  
stone-washed, must despise  
the option of pre-softened jeans,  
and works the rows in brand new  
clothes, chafing to preserve  
something of the old ways,  
for the children, of the earth  
and honest work, in these last days.  


##II

Out here, under old-denim skies,  
in the worn-khaki fields of mankind's  
primal dream, here, hand-shined  
iron still sharpens iron,  
and cotton ... only turns its will  
to time, for Adam to remind:  
when dearth has no part of fear  
then leisure is no kind of wear.
