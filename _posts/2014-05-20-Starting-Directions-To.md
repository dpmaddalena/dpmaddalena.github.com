This a poem mashed up with a piece of music: it started out as a lark and ended up having something interesting to say about life when we've left comfort behind.

The reason I say it started as a lark is that I'm imitating the experience of my smartphone interrupting my music to give me directions. I decided to write my own 'directions', make the computer read them, and then mash it up with a song with a beat (with apologies to The Glitch Mob, who just made the song, called Fistful of Silence, but had no control over what I did with it). I thought it would just be humorous, but it ended up being sort of awesome.

*Listen first (loud), then read the words.*  

### Starting Directions To ...

Starting directions to  
the land that I promise you.  
Proceed to the route.  
Proceed to the route.  
Turn thou neither to the right nor to the left.  

Do not be afraid of the desert.  

Turn thou neither to the right nor to the left;  
nor make up your mind to return to the land  
where Pharaoh broke your back ...  
with bread  

In the endless horizontal,  
there has always been a pillar  
of fire  

And after the scorching desert heat by day   
and fire by night  
only a blind man would miss the cloud.  
Proceed to the route.  
Proceed to the route.  
Proceed to the route.  

At dawn,  
turn to the east and face the rising sun.  
Raise your fist.  

At the right moment, open your hand,  
to reveal its well-traveled lines to the brightening sky.  
And as the heavens read the roadmap of your palm,  
know that you have already come  
home
