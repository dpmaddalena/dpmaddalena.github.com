An audio collage inspired by (and containing) audio samples from the record we sent into space on the Voyager spacecraft. Contains *sounds of Earth* and some music. Of the two music pieces, the Chinese one (a 2500 year-old piece called Flowing Streams) was among the pieces that went into space. The sound samples are all from the original record, only replaced in a couple cases when the originals were too lo-fi.

The 'journey' is about all our impulse to reach out for knowledge, connection, and meaning, and starts with sounds related to that; next we move through the Chinese *be here now* vibe of Flowing Streams; finally we hear a modern musical rendering of Ps 139, a *rediscovery* of the inverse value of God's project, where *we* are visited before we ever make a move.

The Morse Code spells out *per aspera ad astra*. It may be translated as, "through hardships to the heavens."

###Music

"Liu Shui" 《流水》 ("Flowing Streams"). Composed by Bo Ya, played by Kuan P'ing-hu.

Psalm 139:15-16, by Rivers & Robots, from The Verses Project

>My frame was not hidden from You,  
>When I was made in secret,  
>And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth;  
>Your eyes have seen my unformed substance;  
>And in Your book were all written  
>The days that were ordained for me,  
>When as yet there was not one of them  
<p>&nbsp; </p>
