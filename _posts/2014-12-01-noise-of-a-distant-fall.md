Noise of a distant fall and no water\
but drops in the impossible\

suspense. Incongruent the sound,\
that rends our tent, of jets\

over the wilderness. Shrouding,\
shaming the sacred places\

where once we felt small.\
Angry future mechanistic powers\

howling the ancient valleys to sunder\
the old elements of air and water,\

to plunder the limits of humiliated\
primitives, of the comfort\

they once found in nothing.\
Robbed now of rhythm, of rhyme,\

of the gentle massage of time ...\
so now, where once the passive\

moon, soothing, slept us,\
at the roar and sly rebuke\

of the hoary demon, now,\
only rem, rem, rem, rem.\
