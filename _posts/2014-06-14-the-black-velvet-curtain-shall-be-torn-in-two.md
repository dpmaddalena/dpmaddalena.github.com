Monroe, Bogart, Presley, and Dean -  
Café *Boulevard of Broken Dreams*.  
Our breakfast of champions: thin coffee and cream;  
white sugar; waffles; sausage, lean.  

Stars so vivid seem to stand alone,  
so full of meaning to have outgrown  
our substantial span of three —  
thine own dimensional trinity —  
and have become so Real … and so True  
that on this flat earth only two will do.  

The idle look for romance or for peace;  
for tips on how to know or what to feel;  
for what's for breakfast, or when to weep;  
to name our nightmares; to help us sleep.  

Today we search the veil, to reveal  
what lies behind the crocodile's tears.  
It is our story, and it's mostly real:   
the journalism of our hopes and fears.
