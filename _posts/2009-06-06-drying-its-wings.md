All the dreams of caterpillars  
Seem impractical.   
Foolish hairy creeps.   
Inconsiderate visionaries  
Painting airy portraits   
For themselves, invisible  
To the hive. "Why so shy?  
Look to the flowers, grumpy!  
Have some nectar, honey!  
Show some self-respect,   
Insect!" Shamed to see  
All the winged productivity,   
As if the burden of beauty  
Were too great, the beast  
Takes its own bait  
And slinks away to think awhile  
about its purpose, and to die.  

Now, blind to what's transpired,   
And suspicious of a sudden quiet,   
It dries its wings in the sun,  
And gazes out upon the flowers,   
Which bow in its direction.  
The butterfly hears a far  
Vibration, and wonders  
Why, and where the bees did fly.  

On every worm, that plows the waste  
Of better beasts, the life of trees  
Depend. In every creepy caterpillar,   
Dreams of beauty brew  
Invisible, but not unknowable,   
Nor untrue.
