I've been covering my notebooks for years. I started by scratching out brand names and logos on otherwise un-decorated journals. The habit progressed from stickers to fabric, advancing to various other art attacks, collage, and occasional carving (see above). It started simple, and it's gotten to be a regular ritual, one that is a really satisfying, encouraging, and freeing.
