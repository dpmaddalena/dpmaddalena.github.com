A blighted\\
place\\
beatified\\
by strings\\
of tiny\\
fiery lights\\
each with an essential right\\
to tell\\
the story\\

of the spark

that travelled\\
from its start \\
in darkness\\
along\\
a tangled\\
wiry route\\
to mark\\
all the important parts\\
in the plot\\

until the last

of the lamps\\
is warmed\\
for the one\\
and the many\\
to behold\\
and the neighbors\\
who try in vain to seem alone\\
and to remain\\
cold\\
