Many thanks in a pretty blue box,  
And a cellophane promise  
of near eternal shelf-life.  
Body of Christ, O.T.C.  
(just add Welches - sweet  
Purple blood in a bottle). Bland  
Doctors of the modern church  
Prescribe a Saltine pill  
The size of a TicTac -  
Without the salt,  
Without the sweet -  
Once-a-week to guarantee  
Community, chased with that blood  
That causes cavities.  

And here come the Whole Food  
Faithful, organo-hippie  
Holistics, who Feel For You.  
9-Grain Jesus, the Whole  
Body of Christ and a glass of  
Cabernet. Tipsy, taste and see  
That the Lord is ... ooh,  
Is that a little seed in there?  
Little kingdoms inside  
My half-pound loaf.  
I could plant this bread  
And start a garden,  
Or write a folk song  
Expounding on the meaning.  
Or is it just the wine talking?  

Is there need for the bread to tell  
A new story, or the wine to sing  
A new song? Isn't the story  
That was the seed, the song  
That made the kingdom  
Sing, aren't they big enough  
To be contained  
In one Eucharistic Chicklet  
and some grape juice?
