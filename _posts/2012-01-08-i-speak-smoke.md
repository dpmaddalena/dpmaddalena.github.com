I speak  
smoke.  
Not cloud, or other vapors  
inconsistent;  
nor of incense,  
tithed in poverty,  
and lit in holy moments only.  

But I speak the stifle  
and alarm of distant fire,  
about which you might wonder  
before you die -  
whether it's better  
to succumb to fog or flame?  
To blinded eye, or burning limb?  

I stand in the reign and summon  
the rolling billow, and reveal  
the obscuring choke.  
I preach the stoking passion,  
teach mystical inspiration,  
and perform mid-life  
cremations.  

Will we be burned, or languish  
in fire-retardent shacks?  
Will we bow to the pillar,  
or bend to the stacks --  
submit to the furnace or sit  
with the hacks who roll their own  
between phlegmatic coughing fits?  

If only because we burn,  
and can recall the ash  
that flame left after all was made,  
we're given to wear the cloak  
and speak the plume  
of creation's hidden, holy,  
fragrant fume.
