It took about 25 minutes for my son and me to ride our bikes to the Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve. Just look at that scene for a moment. If we had pedaled as far in any other direction, we could have visited a hundred tech landmarks of Silicon Valley: NASA, Google, Xerox PARC, Microsoft, Stanford University, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo, and Hewlett Packard (not to mention the garage(s) where it all started), to name just a few.

But we went *west*.
