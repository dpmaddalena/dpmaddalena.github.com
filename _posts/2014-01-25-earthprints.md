Like wrinkles in a lifted face,  
each sidewalk crack betrays  
the grand design of urban  
masterminds, and plays  
against their perpendiculars,  
poking fun at angles. Right   
or wrong, I laugh along  
(from safely round the corner),  
while sifting meaning from  
the ground and bounding mortar.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; When this earth by discreet  
&nbsp; &nbsp; shifts beneath concrete is  
&nbsp; &nbsp; revealed, a hidden language  
&nbsp; &nbsp; is heard, essential knowledge  
&nbsp; &nbsp; uncoveredâ€”every fracture  
&nbsp; &nbsp; an ancient pattern, each fissure  
&nbsp; &nbsp; apocalyptic, and every rift  
&nbsp; &nbsp; a tattle on the planet  
&nbsp; &nbsp; like a fingerprint  
&nbsp; &nbsp; escaped the glove  
&nbsp; &nbsp; the burglar wore to hide it.  

The signs are the earth is still  
beneath us, and we, with our  
pretty lines and grids, have hidden  
little of our gritty history,  
or of the groaning future  
we thought had passed us by.
