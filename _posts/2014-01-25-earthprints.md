Like wrinkles in a lifted face,  
each sidewalk crack betrays  
the grand design of urban  
masterminds, and plays  
against their perpendiculars,  
poking fun at angles. Right   
or wrong, I laugh along  
(from safely round the corner),  
while sifting meaning from  
the ground and bounding mortar.  

    When this earth by discreet
    shifts beneath concrete is
    revealed, a hidden language
    is heard, essential knowledge
    uncoveredâ€”every fracture
    an ancient pattern, each fissure
    apocalyptic, and every rift
    a tattle on the planet
    like a fingerprint
    escaped the glove
    the burglar wore to hide it.

The signs are the earth is still  
beneath us, and we, with our  
pretty lines and grids, have hidden  
little of our gritty history,  
or of the groaning future  
we thought had passed us by.
