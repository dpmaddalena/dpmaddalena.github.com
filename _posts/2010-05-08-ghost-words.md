Could use a kind word  
About now, a velvet touch,  
To grout the cracks, to stem  
The flow, arrest the oral  
Entropy of seemly weak  
Community. Right about now.  
The spirit won't cooperate,  
Or can't. Instead, the bleed  
Increases, and hungry death  
Encamps.  


Wraith-like words emerge--  
Slimy, demonic under-words,  
Unfriendly, to wake old enemies,  
Which warlike bend against  
The sun on my behalf.  
A whole, wide virgin field  
Is cleared, and battle lines  
Are drawn.  

But before it starts,  
It's done. The end is the beginning.  


Drained and grinning. One helpful  
Ghost is left, and groaning  
With me, in me, softly sends  
Me, through me, words  
Which love-like, split the  
Seams that isolate my hopes,  
My fears, my dreams.
