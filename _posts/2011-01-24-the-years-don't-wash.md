The years don't wash  
away so much as swoosh,  
like water in the family tub,  
when influenced by the shifting  
of conflicting planetary plates  
(earth by waves inflicting).  

At times the years lap up  
against our face as gentle  
memories; sometimes as traces  
of darker days returned from deeper places;  
a tsunami to assault the village of  
our maturity.  

But on many days the laughter  
of a child is heard, who after  
violent protests of cleanliness,  
relents to the humiliation of the bath,  
and makes the action of his or her  
own earthquake with big splashes,  
to the giggled admonishments  
of moms and dads recalling  
their own childhood passions.  

Then, time seems to ride the waves  
of our own making: we lord  
over sea battles, and sailing boats.  
And God? Content to save  
the quaking of the continents,  
while we with soap repent, and the host  
attends to raise our village up on posts.
