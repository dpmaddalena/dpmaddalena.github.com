*The Kiss*, or *Mother and Child*; copper and wood; 10"x7"x48", circa 1995

<p>&nbsp;</p>

A sculpture made for my mother, in a smaller size than its original, from my college days, which is lost. That one was covered and painted rebar, stood 8 feet tall, and was installed on-site at Bennington College until it was accidentally destroyed by the (near-sighted?) driver of a lawnmower. This version is made from copper piping set in an old chunk of railroad tie from her garden. The shadows reveal some of the interesting views afforded by moving around the piece.
