The lifeguard says  
the waves are terrible,  
tossing, a tumbling torture.  
He says that sand  
gets in your pants,  
and salt water tears  
your poor frightened eyes  
wide open.  

Double the trouble  
for him: he's turning  
over and over, under  
the foaming edge of chaos,  
and dragging bathers out,  
only to watch them  
dive back in.  

Do lifeguards hate the sea,  
and fear the open water?  
Swim farther than  
the farthest point  
they've been: nothing  
they can do  
but watch.  

But good swimmers know  
the only escape from  
the trouble of the waves  
is to keep kicking and leave  
the beach behind. Because  
you might not need a lifeguard  
on land, but in the sand there is  
no swimming.
