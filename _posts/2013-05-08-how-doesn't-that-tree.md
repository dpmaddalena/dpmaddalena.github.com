How doesn't that tree fall?  
Look, it split in two,  
right and left,  
straight down  
the trunk along the heart,  
bisected.  

Broken  
with the grain -  
Like it was destiny  
or doom to part,  
like a bull  
at the offering;  
divided, right  

across the  
annual rings  
as if you tore  
every other leaf  
from a history, to make  
two versions, each  
with half the truth;  

black on one side,  
red on the other,  
flaking into  
separate trees.  
Conflicting testimonies;  
still standing, proving  
only uncertainty.  

It was the lightning  
that did it.  
It came out of nowhere:  
a perfectly predictable shock,  
to illuminate the whole  
in unity before the  
second rending crack.  
See, how they stand  
together!  
One should be bent  
in shame,  
to see the other give way  
so quietly  
in obedience to flame.  

But, red now reaches  
round its barking bandage,  
and black is bound  
to bear new color  
in bright relief,  
like a smile  
in a season of grief.  

Conversation unfinished,  
illumination undimmed,  
two hearts  
healing: and a history  
that won't be ended  
and can't be told  
in parts.
