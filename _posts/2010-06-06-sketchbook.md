Images from a small leatherbound "sketchbook" where I play with with images and words, without worrying so much about the big picture. Some of the resulting images would very much like to grow up into poster-sized works of art, if that kind of magic were real. (Look for the single 'found' collage in the series, for a bonus.)

For more on my -ahem- fascination with this artist, read [this piece](http://lowtechwriter.blogspot.com/2009/05/simpler-times.html)  at (low) tech writer, which is also a [book](http://bit.ly/lowtechwriter).
