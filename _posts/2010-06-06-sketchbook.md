Images from a small leatherbound "sketchbook" where I play with with images and words, without worrying so much about the big picture. Some of the resulting images would very much like to grow up into poster-sized works of art.

Each piece is usually just two or three images stuck together when I can't get my brain going for larger, more complicated pieces. Sometimes the book is simply a place to put the too-small collage. But I love a lot of what happens in this little book.

(For a bonus, look for the single 'found' collage in the series.)
