*Echoes of a Future Truth* is a novel-length story in three parts. The project began seven years ago at a time when I was teaching creative writing to San Jose kids to support my masters work in counseling psychology. More specifically, my story began during a shared exercise with a talented 13 year old who went from hating writing to *let's write a book* in a couple months time. Recognizing he was ready, I described how a long story grows from a single idea and gave him a prompt to find his seed-idea. He began to write, inventing his world. With nothing else to do for 90 minutes, I wrote alongside of him and was surprised to be inventing a compelling world of my own. Fast forward to today: I'm ready to publish the complete work this year -- as a single 3-part novel or in some form of serialized text or audio, or a combination of all of these.

[Abrasion](http://www.imby.net/20170525/abrasion) *is a story about the last human being set thousands of years from now. It was written to stand alone, with no thought for further exploration of the world.* [Isolation](http://www.imby.net/20190811/isolation) *also began as a unique project, but drew naturally from a similar place inside of me and so developed into an important meditation on the themes of the first story, ultimately taking its place as a prequel to* Abrasion. *Compared to the character-driven, contemplative qualities of the first two stories,* [Resistance](http://www.imby.net/20220108/resistance) *might be described as a slow burning farce. This third story follows the present-day technicians who scramble to re-imagine human need and human provision before abandoning the last human being to her fate.*
