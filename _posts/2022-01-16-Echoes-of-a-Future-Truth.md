*Echoes of a Future Truth* is a novel-length story in three parts. I began it seven years ago during a time when I was teaching creative writing to San Jose kids to support my masters work in counseling psychology. The project began unexpectedly as a shared exercise with a talented 13 year old who went from *'I hate writing'* to *'I'm ready to write a book'* in a couple months time. During a session he took my prompt and began writing, inventing his world. I wrote alongside of him and was surprised to be inventing a world of my own. What began as a simple exercise became a satisfying meditation on belonging and intimacy, and on the horrors of isolation (especially when community is mediated by technology after most people are gone from the world). My current goal is publication in 2022 -- as a single 3-part novel or in some form of serialized text or audio, or a combination of all of these.

[Abrasion](http://www.imby.net/20170525/abrasion) *is a story about the last human being set thousands of years from now. It was written to stand alone, with no thought for further exploration of the world.* [Isolation](http://www.imby.net/20190811/isolation) *also began as a unique project, but drew naturally from a similar place inside of me and so developed into an important meditation on the themes of the first story, ultimately taking its place as a prequel to* Abrasion. *Compared to the character-driven, contemplative qualities of the first two stories,* [Resistance](http://www.imby.net/20220108/resistance) *might be described as a slow burning farce. This third story follows the present-day technicians who scramble to re-imagine human need and human provision before abandoning the last human being to her fate.*
