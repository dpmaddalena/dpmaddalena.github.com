*Echoes of a Future Truth* is a trilogy of speculative-fiction novellas that began years ago, while I tutored San Jose kids in creative writing to support myself during a professional transition. This project began unexpectedly as a shared exercise with a talented 13 year old who went from *'I hate writing'* to *'I'm ready to write a book'* in a few months time. During one session, as he took my prompt and began writing, inventing his world, I wrote alongside of him and was surprised at the world that opened up before me. What began for me as a simple exercise became a satisfying meditation on belonging and intimacy, and on the horrors of a technologically-mediated provision for community when all the people are gone. I have worked on this project on and off for more than 8 years, and my current goal is publication in 2022 -- as a single 3-part novel or in some form of serialized text or audio, or a combination of all of these.

[Abrasion](http://www.imby.net/20170525/abrasion) *is a story about the last human being set thousands of years from now. It was written to stand alone, with no thought for further exploration of the world.* [Isolation](http://www.imby.net/20190811/isolation) *also began as a unique project, but drew naturally from a similar place inside of me and so developed into an important meditation on the themes of the first story, ultimately taking its place as a prequel to* Abrasion. *Compared to the character-driven, contemplative qualities of the first two stories,* [Resistance](http://www.imby.net/20220108/resistance) *might be described as a slow burning farce. This third story follows the present-day technicians who scramble to re-imagine human need and human provision before abandoning the last human being to her fate.*
