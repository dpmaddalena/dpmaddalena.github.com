Under the nest,  
a broken shell.  
Small crust  
of a world  
that learned  
great things  
too soon.  

From above,  
a sister,  
left over,  
when pressed  
to lose the last  
downy comforts  
from her wings,  

discovers the egg,  
allowed to rest  
below her bed,  
not hidden  
or hurried away;  
the curriculum  
mundane ...  

the awful test  
of life and death,  
between the nest  
and bone-white shell--   
both empty now  
and open  
to the sky.
