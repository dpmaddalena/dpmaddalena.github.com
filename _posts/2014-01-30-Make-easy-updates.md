##Open season

Edmund finds himself haunted by the headless ghost of his great-uncle, who openly accuses him of beheading him and even calling him "Edna" in order to taunt him. Realizing Percy brought the wounded Henry Tudor back to the castle, Edmund, not knowing who he is, questions his wealth, which Henry immediately denies so as to avoid **suspicion**. During the celebratory banquet in **honour** of the new king, a portrait of Henry Tudor is presented for ridicule, and Edmund is horrified to learn that he was sheltering the enemy. Furthermore, when Edmund slips out the secret to his mother that he killed Richard III, Henry Tudor escapes with this knowledge to use in future to exaggerate the history of his predecessor. Eventually, the ghost of Richard III chases Edmund into a foggy meadow while he pursues Henry Tudor, where he meets three witches who address the Black Adder as "Ruler of men, Ravisher of women, Slayer of kings" and predict that he shall one day become king. Edmund thus proclaims "History, here I come!" When he leaves the meadow, the witches remark among themselves that they had expected Henry Tudor to look different, before realizing that they had *prophesied* to the wrong person.
