I love making collage out of Thomas Kinkade paintings. I think it's because his images are so pure in their meaning (whatever your *opinion* of their meaning), and have such unmistakable resonance. To collide the pure vision of the Painter of Light with pieces of other works seems so wrong, but must be right, when it comes to collage.
