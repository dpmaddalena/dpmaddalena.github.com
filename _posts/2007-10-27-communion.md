Gold fades to black  
as if the baker slept and burnt the bread  
and then, if that weren't bad enough,  
the fire went dead.  

And while the dark and cold   
of loneliness crests   
and froths tsunami-like  
above his village,  
He sits down to eat with friends,   
Nero-like in disquieting   
self-conscious annihilation.  

He tears at bread. "I'm torn  
between you  
and me."   
He rips at the loaf that's warm and hollow  
enough for a tap   
to reveal it was finished.  
The empty in-between defines   
the shape of things.  
The rising golden warmth says  
you're home at any hearth.  

Then he drains the skin, the heart   
about spent, emptied, divided   
and walked between.   
He says his thanks, and pours a drink,   
reminding the cup of it's purpose:   
to be full and always  
to be emptied--the perfect   
pregnant surface   
offered to the thing that breaks it.  

"I'm giving me to taking you.  
Your hungry bowl, my angry cup;  
your cup of wine, my empty bowl.  
My wine delayed   
until my home   
is warmed again".  
This bowl of time stopped   
at the rim   
and quivering;   
its surface holding history back--  
not like glass, which keeps us from   
the things we're looking at,  
but like wine, which is like blood,  
which they say is thicker than water,  
which could tell you a thing or two  
about tension.  

Waiting,  
for a tilt of the planet   
towards tomorrow.  
Remembering,   
to hold the wave aloft.  
Waiting  
for the bread to rise,   
and the cup to fill and   
hoping, remembering ...   
that home is where the hearth is,   
and if that weren't good enough,  
the fire still has life in it.  
And the meal calls us back to the table.
