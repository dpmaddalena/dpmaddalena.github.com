Here's a mystery\\
I can't explain, except\\
to say this earth was made\\
for people, and people made\\
for it: the mountain,\\
thunder-topped, erupted\\
master humbler,\\
is not so big that we\\
can't find our way around,\\
across, or through it. Not\\
so small, neither, that\\
prayer can be forgot.\\
