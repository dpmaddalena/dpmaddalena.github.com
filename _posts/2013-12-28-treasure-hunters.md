## I

My grandpa had a dusty  
plate of seashells, dry,  
and in plastic trays, a score  
of tree parts, petrified;  
each a hardened image  
of an old, indurable thing.  
(His trees had rock rings -  
each marked a hundred years  
of settling, from under-sea  
memorials to the life of things  
once living.) Do they honor age  
and greatness? Or mock  
with minerals the fragility  
of trees in their relative youth,  
and old invertebrates  
for their few years on earth? 

My mother also hunts for shells  
and tiny priceless things  
on walks outside, to fill  
the permanent solo show  
on the shelves around her home.  
Grandpa taught us where  
to start, but momma taught me art,  
to revel in the fingering of stone  
until it shone from human touch  
and time.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some will even grind  
these rocks up into jewels,  
to reveal the deeper secrets  
and unhide the truer themes  
of what the earth wrings  
by pressure from simple dust  
and ancient buried dreams.  


## II

I also collect things, and find  
that I inherited the eye,  
though I don't often get the time  
to walk the wilds, to discover old  
bones and gems by ancient trails,  
outside.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today, I’m a panner  
for urban gold—my claim spans  
the blocks, and mines the old  
and ever-rising asphalt-mantled  
roads; I sift the grit and duff  
that cruft and clog the binding  
slough, that fill the cracks that jog  
across the busted walks that sit  
beside the avenues.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact,  
in cities … I don't mind the trees,  
nor always wish for grassy fields.  
No. I take this place for what it is:  
a forest of human things that rise  
and stand; some parts designed  
to last, to resist the wear of wind  
and water, and some to be replaced  
as fast as the shifting of the weather.  
 
Along this breaking beach I walk,  
between the rising dreams of men,  
who’s trophies scratch at heaven,  
and the crashing waves of time,  
that grind to sand the things  
our hands have brought to life.  
Here, what was so wonderful  
and clear succumbs to the craft  
of years, rarely to become  
embalmed, and allowed to stay,  
enshrined or ennobled  
by what’s been taken away.  

It’s trash —okay! If you insist  
on seeing it that way.  
It's bottle caps and broken glass,  
car parts, and other shards  
of ancient, manufactured things—  
once skipped along suburban  
streams, now fractured and settling  
into dusty pools and poisonous  
eddies that collect where raging  
urban rivers intersect.  

Here, even ugly things are  
made to gleam: iron and her  
alloys are redeemed—abraded,  
ground and buffed by water  
and time, to pock and rough  
the surface, hastening  
the inevitable blush of rust,  
and other signs of softening  
that time conveys to human stuff.  
Here, also, trucks by rubber pestle  
cast-offs into jewels against  
the mortar of our gritty, ribboned,  
urban tracks.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here, nature keeps  
her eye on man, to shame the vanity  
of our shiny plans. Though trees and clams  
seem happy to be reduced to stone,  
we resist, pretend that we don’t know  
that humankind is aging also: getting  
harder in the heart, and each year  
softer in the gut.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime,  
mama gathers up our proud inanimates  
in bits and pieces to her mantle,  
to polish, corrode, and make  
more precious our ignoble junk,  
and claim for glory countless things  
that we, neglectful, send  
to the icy bottom of her ancient sea,  
where in her cleansing stream,  
she rehearses an old and dusty dream.
