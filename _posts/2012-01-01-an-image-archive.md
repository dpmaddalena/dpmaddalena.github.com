I have a number of websites out there holding a handful of images, some captured for art, some to document a project. Flickr has a handful. Here there are some nice images from when I was shooting on a Panasonic Lumix, and others of some maker projects of that era. 

It isn't a big collection, scroll down to see the iPhone amp that Anthropologie wanted me to mass produce, and the lazy-maker bike rack that almost made me famous on the internet.
