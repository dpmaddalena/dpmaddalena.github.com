I was in Greece this month on a trip that lasted, for me, only ten days. I went primarily to reconnect to Anghelika's siblings and mom -- it had been 14 years since I'd been there, and I missed them. I had, after all, married all three of the Elliott Sisters in Greece, one as husband (I am writing this on my own wedding anniversary), and two as officiant. Brother Stephen made sure to tell me, after Maggie was married to Jimmy, and after Lucy was married to Andrew on a small island off of Eretria, that he himself was now free to marry -- highlighting a Greek tradition that young men will wait for marriage until their sisters are accounted for -- and he thanked me in particular for doing my part. 

Besides family, I was excited for several things I knew I would be able to enjoy, in no particular order: food, family art, and the beauty of old churches.

Anghelika's grandfather, Spyros Vassiliou, was a well-known painter. One of his favorite themes from during and after the German occupation of WWII, was _freedom_. Here is a three-color woodcut print showing Eleutheria setting the captives free ... there was no artist's paint for sale during the war years, but wood was always available.

A favorite theme of mine: the design language of the orthodox church of the last millenium. Unlike the inarguably beautiful, soaring fan-vaults of gothic churches, which seem only to gve the effect of great ambiguous space above you, and stretch the distance from the doorway to the altar, the cruiciform orthodox church makes every surface feel like a opportunity for intimate devotion, ones own window into a part of the heavenly drama. The spaces, no matter how large, seem like a refuge, a holding space, equally intimate for the gathered community and for each individual pilgrim, from any vantage point. 

The (one time) Cathedral of Aghiou Dimytriou in Athens; Grandpa Spyros painted the frescos throughout the interior of this beautiful church.

And the exteriors of a smaller church in Mani, showing a similar organic ethic in design ... a shape and texture that feels very human in scale and quality ... especially if that human is a resident of the wilder places in Greece.

## Mani in the Footsteps of Arpaxos

Owing to the short duration of our trip, I held out little hope I'd be able to do much touring, but I had my character Arpaxos in mind. Arpaxos is the antihero of _Isolation_ (part two of my novel [_Echoes of a Future Truth_](http://www.imby.net/20220116/Echoes-of-a-Future-Truth)), a story that takes place entirely in Greece and primarily on the Mani Peninsula of the Peloponese. When COVID hit the family just before we arrived, we realized we had a few days to spend on our own; we headed out to explore the locations of the story.

I'm here to tell you, Arpaxos _got away from it all_. Anghelika and I attempted to reach the church of his exile, on the southwestern cape of Mani, but were unsuccessful. Though the churches in _Isolation_ are amalgams of the many old Greek churches I have visited over the years, I had never been to the two in the story, which were found on maps and chosen for their remoteness. The character arrives at a small church on the top of the cliffs of Cape Grosso, called Agia Sotira (= 'of the savior'), and expects to spend his last days there. He _stumbles_ onto another, smaller church built within a cave, halfway down the cape's western cliffs, called Agia Eleousa (= 'of the merciful one'). 

Here they both are on a satellite image of the peninsula, shown viewed from west to east, in the ancient-map style. You can see one of Arpaxos' stops at the top-left: Gytheon (a name that combines the Greek words for Earth and God), where Anghelika and I set up a cozy base camp. The two churches are down on the bottom-right, marked in yellow.

## To Agia Sotyra

We made two attempts to get to Sotyra on the ridge. Here is the massive Cape Grosso (_grosso_ means a bulk or mass) from the north-east. this image is taken from the Tigani Peninsula, a perspective that suggests no easy access ...

<img src='/assets/arpa/grosso-n.jpg' width='600'>

We hoped to use a trail from the south -- visible on my Greek army topo map -- shown climbing up a smaller east face, then turning along the ridge to lead a pilgrim to the lonely church at the northern tip; the greek work printed alongside the trail, xemounto, is an archaic word that means _went out_

<img src='/assets/arpa/grosso-topo.jpg' width='600'>

But after trying with all the tools available to us (digital and paper maps, satelite images, GPS, and a few decades experience in backcountry travel in the US and Greece), we had to give up on this route. Later, we learned from a local man that 'this trail has collapsed' (we only saw two locals after hours of driving and scouting this part of Mani); here is a view of where the neglected trail begins, between two old orchard walls ...

<img src='/assets/arpa/ancient-paths.jpg' width='600'>

And, what we soon encountered: wild bushes obscuring a path that should have taken us up the face ...

<img src='/assets/arpa/grosso-e.jpg' width='600'>

I cleared the way as best I could, but we never found a route to take us up the ridge, only wildlife paths continually trending south to a (currently empty) watering hole. We gave up and left the path to the thorns and 'great yellow spiders'. I walked through a lot of spider webs! The spiders never fought back, but when we turned around, and Anghelika led the way, she noticed that she was walking through webs already under repair. Diligent little creatures.

I also walked through a bunch of these sticky thorns, and they were considerably more aggressive in defending the place from foreign invaders. The irridescent scarabs munching on their flowers were as unperturbed as the spiders.  

<img src='/assets/arpa/thorns.jpg' width='600'>

<img src='/assets/arpa/scarabs.jpg' width='600'>

I was disappointed that I couldn't find the trail, or even get to the base of the cliff. Anghelika encouraged me not to give up: we drove around looking for any sign of a way up, until we met Stavros, the local who confirmed the non-existence of the northern path. But, he said, 'there is anotehr way ...', assuring us that he climbed the hill for a view of the sea every day. He also said, 'sometimes I take people like you up, and sometimes I have to go up there to help people get down.' 

We took note of his directions and thanked him, unsure of whether we'd have time or energy for another attempt, or whether we could come back in the morning to follow him up the ridge. After a drive to a fish taverna 30 minutes up the coast where we refuelled and refilled our bottles, we returned to make our own attempt. The surviving trail, said Stavros, 'leaves from the top of the cemetery past Lagoudi√°, and is very clear, easy to the top; then it all opens up ... anyone with a _strong heart and good shoes_ can walk along the ridge', where, he said, we would pass several churches. Here is the 'easy path' ...

<img src='/assets/arpa/easyway.jpg' width='600'>

These bushes are indeed 'the kind that goats don't eat', and were prickly-painful to walk through, even for Anghelika, who wore jeans; a short time after we made the ridge, we found the first church, complete with ancient columns among the wreckage ...

<img src='/assets/arpa/church.jpg' width='600'>

<img src='/assets/arpa/column.jpg' width='600'>

The presence of a column is not itself a sign of great age, but normal practice for the church-builders of Mani, who were happy to repurpose classical ruins in the making of places of worship. Nevertheless, this church could be 900 years old. It is not a tourist destination, because, in Mani there are just _hundreds_ of these ruins, both ancient and medieval, scattered across the peninsula.

Alas, shortly after arriving at this church, the wild rocky way became impassable; it took us 45 minutes to cover the kilometer from cemetery to church and we had 3 kilometers to go ... in the heat of the mid-afternoon ... through this ... 

<img src='/assets/arpa/whatgoatsdonteat.jpg' width='600'>

In between the choke of pokey bushes were rocks both sharp and unstable, risking turned ankles and shredded shoes. Both of us were in running shoes, which is a little embarrasing to admit; in my defense, I have hiked well over a thousand miles through wilderness, under heavy loads, often without trails, most recently in very simple shoes like the ones I was wearing. Nevertheless, I was totally beaten by this landscape. Anghelika and I both wondered whether I needed to reconsider my literary descriptions of Mani's landscape ('you need to add more rocks,' said she), but I remain confident in my depictions: I tell myself that Arpaxos and his father would have walked paths known to the locals, like Stavros, during their frequent visits, and that, when he came to Agia Sotyra for his self-imposed exile, he would have taken his time on what he considered to be his final journey.

## Agia Eleousa

I knew that I wouldn't be able to visit the church that Arpaxos falls to halfway through _Isolation_, because I wasn't willing to slide down the cliff face like he did! The real-world church is accessible from the sea and a rough trail from below, but we didn't have time to hire a boat. Again, this church is an amalgam of churches I have visited. Here is a shot of the entry to the actual church.

<img src='/assets/arpa/eleousa.PNG' width='600'>

Because we couldn't see Eleousa, we walked a couple kilometers to another cliffside church --Agia Odygytria. The many caves in the western cliffs of the deep Mani give the cape its other name, Thyrides, or _cape of lockers_. 

Odygytria has some of the details common to all old Greek houses of worship, and some that I was surprised to see -- like the spring I discovered in a cave behind it that is much like the spring I invented for Arpaxos' cave.

A 'single, rush-covered chair' on a marble floor.

Tamata, or votive offerings, are stamped metal petitions (or signs of gratitude) for healing -- the first image has the word for 'thanks' stamped in the metal. Underneath are images of body parts, the silver ones 'tarnished and dull' ...

Some tamata surrounding an icon of Agia Elias, or St Elijah. 

<img src='/assets/arpa/tamata-elias.jpg' width='600'>

Sometimes the frescoes in churches are damaged by time, sometimes by vandals. In Odygytria, the frescoes are unmolested. This is a unique and well-preserved image of an archangel, notable for the metal nibs that create a pattern in the clothing.

A pretty detail in the floor, showing what I guess is the cosmos, here depicted with something breaking in from beyond ...

A censor for burning incense.

A certain greek woman manifesting that impulse to keep the churches 'cleaned and swept'.

Finally, a couple images of Mani's towers, from which families would fend off attackers, be they Turkish invaders, enemies from other villages, or feuding neighbors within their own.

In the end I was pleased that so many small details I wrote about were present in the churches we visited and in the landscape, reinforcing my memories of long-past visits. And I admit to being frustrated that the landscape was also exactly as harsh as I remembered it, so much so that I was prevented from earning membership in the Arpaxos Society. Oh well! Beautiful and wild country. Maybe I will return one day and hire Stavros for the day.
