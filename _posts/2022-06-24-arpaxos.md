I traveled to Greece this month for a trip that lasted only ten days. It was primarily to reconnect to Anghelika's siblings and mom -- it had been 14 years since I'd been there, and I missed them. I had, after all, married all three of the Elliott Sisters, one as husband (I am writing this on my own wedding anniversary), and two as officiant -- brother Stephen made sure to tell me, after Maggie was married to Jimmy, and after Lucy was married to Andrew on a small island off of Eretria, that he now was free to marry, highlighting a Greek tradition that young men will wait to marry until their sisters are accounted for -- and he thanked me in particular for doing my part. 

Owing to the short duration of our trip, I held out a little hope I'd be able to do much touristing, but I had my character Arpaxos in mind. Arpaxos is the antihero of _Isolation_ (part two of my novel [_Echoes of a Future Truth_](http://www.imby.net/20220116/Echoes-of-a-Future-Truth)), a story that takes place entirely in Greece. When COVID hit some family members just before we arrived, we realized we had a few days to spend on our own; we headed for Mani to retrace the steps Arpaxos takes in the story.

I'm here to tell you, Arpaxos _got away from it all_. Anghelika and I attempted to reach his church on the southwestern cape of Mani, but were unsuccessful. Though the churches in Isolation are amalgams of many old Greek churches I have visited over the years, I had never been to the two in the story -- his first destination on the top of the cliffs of Cape Grosso, called Agia Sotira (= 'of the savior'), and one nestled in the cliff below that he 'stumbles on' later, called Agia Eleousa (= 'of the merciful one'). I picked these churches precisely because they were remote. Here they are on a satellite shot of the peninsula, shown viewed from the West, ancient-map-style. You can see one of Arpaxos' stops at the top-left: Gytheon (a name that combines the Greek words for Earth and God), where Anghelika and I set up our cozy base camp. The two churches are down on the bottom-right, marked in yellow. _Note: right-click on any image and open it 'in a new tab' to be able to view it full size_.

## To Agia Sotyra

And, wow, were they remote. We made two attempts to get to Sotyra on the ridge, shown here from the north-east (from another cliff-bound church called Agia Odigytria), a perspective that suggests we will not be successful ...

We hoped to use a trail visible on my Greek army topo map, further to the south:

<img src='/assets/arpa/grosso-topo.jpg' width='600'>

But after trying with all the tools available to me (GPS, digital and paper maps, satelite images, and a few decades experience in backcountry travel in the US and Greece), we had to admit defeat. Later, we learned from a local named Stavros that 'that trail has collapsed' (we only saw two locals in hours of driving and scouting this part of Mani); here is a view of where the neglected trail begins, between two old orchard walls ...

And, what we soon encountered: wild bushes obscuring the path that should have taken us up this face ...

<img src='/assets/arpa/grosso-e.jpg' width='600'>

I cleared the way as best I could, but we never found a path to take us up the ridge, only wildlife paths continually trending south to a (currently empty) watering hole. We gave up and left the path to the thorns and 'great yellow spiders'. I walked through a lot of spider webs! The spiders never fought back, but when we turned around, and Anghelika led the way, she noticed that she was walking through webs already under repair. Diligent little creatures.

I also walked through a bunch of these sticky thorns, and they were considerably more aggressive in their defense of the home turf. The scarabs munching on their flowers were as unperturbed as the spiders.

I was disappointed that I couldn't find the trail, or even get to the base of the cliff. Anghelika insisted we not give up: we drove around looking for any sign of a way up, until we met Stavros, the local who confirmed the non-existence of our path. He said, 'there is a way ...', assuring us that he walked up the hill for a view of the sea every day. He also said that 'sometimes I take people like you up, and sometimes I have to go up there to help people get down.' 

We took note of his directions and thanked him, unsure of whether we'd have time or energy for another attempt, or whether we could come back in the morning when he would climb the ridge. After a drive to a fish taverna 30 minutes up the coast where we refuelled and refilled our bottles, we returned to make our own attempt. The path, said Stavros, 'leaves from the top of the cemetery past Lagoudi√°, and is very clear, easy to the top; then it all 'opens up', and 'anyone with a _strong heart and good shoes_ can walk along the ridge', where, he said, 'you will pass several churches'. Here is the 'easy path' ...

These bushes are indeed 'the kind that goats don't eat', and were prickly-painful to walk through, even for Anghelika, who wore jeans; when we made the ridge, we found the first church, complete with ancient columns among the wreckage ...

<img src='/assets/arpa/church.jpg' width='600'>

<img src='/assets/arpa/column.jpg' width='600'>

The presence of the column is not itself a sign of great age, but normal practice for the church-builders of Mani, who were happy to repurpose classical ruins in the making of places of worship. Nevertheless, this church is likely around 700-900 years old. It is NOT a tourist destination, because, in Mani there are just _hundreds_ of these ruins, both ancient and medieval, scattered across the peninsula.

Alas, shortly after arriving at this church, the wild rocky way became impassable; it took us 40 minutes to cover the kilometer from cemetery to church and we had 3 to go ... through this ...

In between the choke of pokey bushes, those rocks are both sharp and unstable, risking turned ankles and shredded shoes -- both of us were in running shoes, which is a little embarrasing to admit, but in my defense, I have hiked well over a thousand miles through wilderness, under heavy loads, often without trails, frequently in very simple shoes like the ones I was wearing, and I was totally beaten by this landscape. Anghelika and I both wondered whether I needed to reconsider my descriptions of Mani's landscape ('More rocks!' said she). I remain confident in my depiction of Mani. I told myself that Arpaxos and his father would have walked paths known only to the locals, like Stavros, during childhood visits, and that, when he came to Agia Sotyra during his self-imposed exile, he would have taken his time on what he considered to be his final journey.

## Agia Eleousa

I knew that I wouldn't be able to visit the church that Arpaxos falls to halfway through Isolation, because I wasn't willing to slide down the cliff face like he did! The real-world church is accessible from the sea and a rough trail from below, but we didn't have time to hire a boat. Again, this church is an amalgam of churches I have visited, both on the surface and in caves. Here is another visitor's shot of the entry to the actual church.

Because we couldn't see Eleousa, we walked a couple kilometers to another cliffside church --Agia Odigytria. This church has some of the details common to all old Greek houses of worship, and some that I was surprised to see -- like the spring I discovered in a cave behind Odigytria that is much like the spring I invented for Arpaxos' cave.

Tamata, or votive offerings, are stamped metal petitions for healing, or signs of gratitude -- the first image has the word for 'thanks' stamped in the metal. Underneath are images of body parts, the silver ones 'tarnished and dull' ...

Sometimes the frescoes in churches are damaged by time, sometimes by vandals. Occasionally the eyes have been removed. In Odigytria, the frescoes are unmolested. This is a unique and well-preserved image of an archangel.

A pretty detail in the floor, showing what I guess is the cosmos, here depicted with something breaking in from beyond ...

Finally, a couple images of Mani's towers, from which families would fend off attackers, be they Turkish invaders, enemies from other villages, or feuding neighbors within their own.

In the end I was pleased that so many small details I wrote about were present in the churches we visited and in the landscape, reinforcing my memories of long-past visits. And I admit to being frustrated that the landscape was just exactly as harsh as I remembered it, so much so that I was prevented from earning membership in the Arpaxos Society. Oh well! Beautiful and wild country. Maybe I will return one day and hire Stavros for the day.
