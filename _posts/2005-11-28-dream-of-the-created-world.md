Flashlights under the covers,  
playing like cavers, diving  
deep into giddy infancy.  
Though a proud dream-stag  
might poke you out of slumber,  
drift, spelunker, underground lover--  
begged blessings hover  
like a funky patchwork raft  
you're riding under. The light  
and lethe comforter is the night--  
the world turns in, turns to forgetting,  
creeping easter, "Flashlights on!"  
No hope in rising! Who craves and hunkers  
down to wait? ... World turns,  
God pulls the covers up.  
You fight to not forget, while  
revelers stall, stealing light  
from above: stay sharp, heads up.  
Each work of day rolls over,  
above and of the surface,  
and yet the earth careers to  
other rhythms, finally cloaked  
and orthodox ... asleep, unseen  
where youth are left to rise,  
and plunge towards the center,  
under the covers, where motion  
is never felt.
