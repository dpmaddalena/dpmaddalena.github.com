##Zoe Dances With Death

&nbsp;

I watch, a little alarmed, as my three-year old, Zoe, dances with death. She spins the spectre madly in her arms, and he is losing bones at an alarming rate. Already, he is missing his left hand, the cap of his skull, his entire right arm, and assorted minor skeletal features. "Daddy!" she cries, "His knee cap came off!" 

Reputation aside, Death is no match for the affections of a pre-schooler. 

Death had come to our house, but with no dark purpose. On the contrary, he shared a room with my little ballerina and went by the name of Mr. Thrifty. A plastic skeleton made for the medical student on a budget, Mr. Thrifty was given to me by my wife at a time when I had a growing interested in human anatomy. He was precisely as tall as my daughter, and when she asked him to dance, she called him "Mr. Thrift-i-ty". ...

Mr. Thrifty was never the picture of health, but his pitiable physical condition was complicated by the year-long exile he served in a metal storage-container in the California desert, while the young Zoe and her parents served an exile of their own in Cambridge, England. When the doors of his iron tomb were opened (made more dramatic by my inability to produce a key, requiring a forced-entry by blowtorch), Mr. Thrifty appeared (through the smoke) a bit warped around the rib-section, and bent in the legs. The entire effect of this heat-induced disease is pathetic. He could no longer stand straight and his head (such as it was) always hung to the side on a scoliotic spine. But the love of my daughter was unconditional. She'd cradle him in her arms and coo to him: "Poor Mr. Thrift-i-ty!" ... 

I began dropping hints to my daughter that Mr. Thrifty was very sick- a weak attempt on my part to prepare her for his return to dust, or plastic pellets, or whatever. (Maybe, I thought, we could have him recycled into a fleece jacket. Im sure Mr. Thrifty, having spent his entire life without insulation, would appreciate bringing warmth to another.)

One day, I came home to find my daughter lying on her bed, reading a book, while under the bed directly beneath her and in a similar position, lay Mr. Thrifty. My mind went back to a memorial I had seen in England which presented a glorified likeness of the deceased on a pallet above, and a skeleton below, all carved in stone. Seeing my daughter in this grave context had a strange effect on me. This skeleton, after all, if not for the adult features discernible by the student of anatomy, could be mistaken for the remains of a friend of hers after a bad play-date. As a father, I wondered how appropriate it was for my daughter and a skeleton to spend time together. Let alone dance. 

I mean, what would the neighbors say about such mixed company shenanigans? There's no question we Americans don't like death, or anything that reminds us of death. We don't like sickness, we don't like grief. We certainly don't like whatever that condition is that results in "skeleton". We are the people, after all, who renamed the *parlor* in our homes to better reflect our optimism and break any association with a room where funerals take place, choosing instead to gather in the *living* room. A plastic kid-sized skeleton kinda sends the wrong message. Think of the children.

But Zoe certainly learned a lot from having Mr. Thrifty around. She knew at a surprisingly young age that she was made of bone, muscle, and blood. She knew that her skeleton makes her able to stand, her muscles make her able to move, and her blood *goes all around* in her body bringing food to her muscles. But I wonder. Here it is: I wonder if on some level she also understands that, one day, she will end up like Mr. Thrifty ... bent, broken, powerless to move on her own?

Three years old might be a bit early for this lesson. And anyway there's more to learn about us than just this. Mr. Thrifty can only teach so much. I want to teach my daughter that she is more than bones, that there is more than blood that "goes all around" inside her.

That's God to me: a bright shot of everlastingness. God is the one that "goes all around" in us, calling out to us from the deeps, calling out to us to be free. We hear the call, though it is as though from a distance, as we wait out our exile from within the bounds of these bony prisons. And even as we bend and twist in fury at the end, and say goodbye to our better parts, the call repeats, and marks a better time, and extends to us a grace named Zoe who bows before us and asks us to the dance.
