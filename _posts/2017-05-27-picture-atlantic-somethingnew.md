Stage video for the [Picture Atlantic](http://www.pictureatlantic.com) tune *Something New*, debuted at PA's 2015 Halloween show. Video collage composed of HD video of the Sun from Nasa's archives and original content filmed by the artist. This video has a creeping meditative quality, a building tension, and good payoff at the end.
