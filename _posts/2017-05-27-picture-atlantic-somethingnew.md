Stage video for the [Picture Atlantic](http://www.pictureatlantic.com) tune *Something New*, debuted at PA's 2015 Halloween show. Video collage with some HD footage of our sun from NASA combined with original content (self-portrait filmed on an iPhone 5, if I rememeber correctly). This video has a creeping meditative quality, a building tension, and good payoff at the end.
