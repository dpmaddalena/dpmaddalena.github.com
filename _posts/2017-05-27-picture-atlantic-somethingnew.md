Stage video for the [Picture Atlantic](http://www.pictureatlantic.com) tune *Something New*, debuted at PA's 2015 Halloween show. Video collage composed of an HD video of the Sun from Nasa's archives and slow motion footage of the artist walking. This video has a creeping meditative quality, a building tension, and good payoff at the end.
