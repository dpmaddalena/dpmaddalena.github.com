###Ethics

I'm in class with Don St. Luis right now. had a good nap before teaching, a fun acting class, and now listening to case studies about record keeping and informed consent. Standard of care for the win. So few laws, and so so much fear about getting it right. 

####Simple laws
Effective January 1, 2000, Dept. of Consumer Affairs, Business and Professions Code Section 4982 (v) was added to include *as unprofessional conduct*, “Failure to keep records consistent with sound clinical judgment, the standards of the profession, and the nature of the services being rendered.”
