This video installation was shown in my house during an all-day Easter celebration. It was purposely projected against the side of a narrow hallway, so that the images would skew along the wall in playful perspective, intimately close to guests as they passed through the cramped space. 

The visuals are all macro images of 8mm film stock from my early childhood (1966-74), a time of innocence for me. The music is from Mind Tree's *Element4l* soundtrack.
