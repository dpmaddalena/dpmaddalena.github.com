This video installation was projected on the wall in my house during an all-day Easter celebration. It was purposely shown in a cramped space, so that the images would skew along the wall in playful perspective, intimately close to guests as they passed through a hallway. 

The visuals are all macro images of 8mm film stock from my early childhood (early 1970s), a time of innocence for me. The music is from Mind Tree's *Element4l* soundtrack.
