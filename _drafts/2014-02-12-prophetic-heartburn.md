Wow. Jeremiah.

Love and rape and shame and abuse and apostasy and the worst heartburn ever and a very difficult pregnancy ... metaphors for prophecy in Jeremiah 20.

O LORD, you have enticed me,
        and I was enticed;
    you have overpowered me,
        and you have prevailed.
    I have become a laughingstock all day long;
        everyone mocks me.
     For whenever I speak, I must cry out,
        I must shout, “Violence and destruction!”
    For the word of the LORD has become for me
        a reproach and derision all day long.
     If I say, “I will not mention him,
        or speak any more in his name,”
    then within me there is something like a burning fire
        shut up in my bones;
    I am weary with holding it in,
        and I cannot.
