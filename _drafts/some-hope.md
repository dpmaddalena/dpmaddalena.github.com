This video installation (here in raw video form) was projected on the wall in a hallway in my house during an all-day Easter celebration. It was purposely projected in a cramped space, so that the images would skew along the wall in tortured perspective, intimately close to guests as they walked through the hallway to the back of the house. 

The images are all macro photographs of 8mm film stock from my early childhood, a time of untrammeled innocence.
