Monroe, Bogart, Presley, and Dean -  
Cafe Boulevard of Broken Dreams.   
The breakfast of champions: thin coffee and cream;  
white sugar; waffles; sausage, lean.   

Things so vivid seem ... apart, alone,  
so full of meaning to have outgrown  
the third dimension  
and have become so real™ and so true™  
that on this flat earth, only two will do.

The idle look for romance or for peace;  
for tips on how to know, or what to feel;  
for what's for breakfast, or when to weep;  
to name our nightmares, to help us sleep.  

The veil is the answer: it will reveal  
what lies behind the crocodile's tears.   
It is our story, and it's mostly real,   
headline journalism of our hopes and fears.
