*Lost World* is video project created from the 1925 silent film adaption of Arthur Conan Doyle's novel, that is itself the inspiration for *King Kong*.

- **Images**: the black and white film was stressed with various forced-color and contrast settings in Blender, then doubled and de-synced to create serendipitous juxtopositions. 
- **Music**: *The National Anthem* by Radiohead
