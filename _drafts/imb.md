The name of my website, which always needs explaining, is imby.net, and is a play off the acronym, NIMBY. "NIMBY" means Not In My Back Yard, and is basically a "No" vote for anything we feel doesn't belong in our neighborhood, be it a nuclear power plant or a person of another color. IMBY is the "Yes" vote, when it comes to people and community (not necessarily Nuclear power plants). IMBY is also a four-letter domain name that I purchased back when short domain names were disappearing. Sometimes I think it's too "cute" sounding and I want to dump it for something hipper-sounding or web-savvy like "maddale.na", but I still like what imby stands for.

And, once, I looked up "imb" words in the dictionary, and found that there are very few of them, and the ones that are there tell a kind of interesting story. Here's that list (originally posted on imby.net back in the bronze age of the webernet) The list brings to mind the party game where a player has to form a sentence from a list of terms. And ... begin!
