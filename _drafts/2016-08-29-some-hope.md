This video installation (here in raw video form) was projected on the wall in a hallway in my house during an all-day Easter celebration. It was purposely projected in a cramped space, so that the images would skew along the wall in playful perspective, intimately close to guests as they walked through the hallway in transition from one interaction to another. 

The images are all macro photographs of 8mm film stock from my early childhood, a time of innocence. Music from Mind Tree's Element4l soundtrack.
