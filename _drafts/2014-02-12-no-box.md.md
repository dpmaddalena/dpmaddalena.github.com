As I read countless job postings on the internets for the creative team players who are excellent communicators, think outside of the box, and thrive in fast-paced environments, I kind of wonder if anybody is 'in the box' anymore. I mean, I understand the code: who would tell a prospective employer that they aren't creative, can't communicate good, prefer slow-paced environments, and would rather work alone. Those are easy. But this bit about being an out-of-the-box thinker ... what is that? What's the box? Old school thinking? Group mind? Conventional thinking?

And if the only people you hire are out-of-the-box thinkers, doesn't that just redefine the box? I mean if everyone at a company like Google (20,000 employees worldwide) thinks outside the box, that would mean that there really is no box anymore, right?
