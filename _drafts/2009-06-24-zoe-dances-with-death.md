##Zoe Dances with Death

[revised 090624]

I watch with amusement and alarm as my three-year old, Zoe, dances with death. She spins him madly in her arms, and he is losing bones at an alarming rate. Already, he is missing his left hand, the cap of his skull, his entire right arm, and assorted minor skeletal features (“Daddy!” she cries, “His knee cap came off!”). 

Reputation aside, Death is no match for the affections of a pre-schooler. 
 Death has visited this house, but with no dark purpose. On the contrary, he shares a room with my little ballerina and goes by the name of “Mr. Thrifty”. A plastic skeleton made for the medical student on a budget, Mr. Thrifty was given to me by my wife at a time when I had a growing interested in human anatomy. He is precisely as tall as my daughter, and when she asks him to dance, she calls him "Mr. Thrift-i-ty". ... 

Mr. Thrifty’s pitiable physical condition, while never great, was complicated by the year-long exile he served in a metal storage-container in the California desert, while the young Zoe and her parents served an exile of their own in Cambridge, England. When the doors of his iron tomb were opened (made more dramatic by my inability to produce a key, requiring a forced-entry by blowtorch), Mr. Thrifty appeared (through the smoke) a bit warped around the rib-section, and bent in the legs. The entire effect of this heat-induced disease is pathetic. He no longer stands straight and his head (such as it is) always hangs to the side on a scoliotic spine. But the love of my daughter is unconditional: she cradles him in her arms and coos to him, “poor Mr. Thrift-i-ty. ...”  

I keep hinting to my daughter that Mr. Thrifty is very sick- a pathetic attempt on my part to prepare her for his return to dust, or plastic pellets, or whatever. (Maybe we could have him recycled into a fleece jacket; I’m sure Mr. Thrifty, having spent his entire life without insulation, would appreciate bringing warmth to someone else.)
 One day I came home to find my daughter lying on her bed, reading a book, while under the bed, directly beneath her and in a similar position, lay Mr. Thrifty. My mind went back to memorials I had seen in England which had a glorified likeness of the deceased on a pallet above, and the skeleton below, all carved in stone. Seeing my daughter in this grave context had a strange effect on me. This skeleton, after all, if not for the adult features discernible by the student of anatomy, could be mistaken for the remains of a friend of hers after a bad play-date. As a father, I wonder how appropriate it is for my daughter and a skeleton to spend time together. Let alone dance. 

What would the neighbors say about such mixed company shenanigans? There's no question we Americans don't like death, or anything that reminds them of death. We don't like sickness, we don't like grief. We are the people, after all, who renamed the "parlor" in our homes to better reflect our optimism and break any association with a room where funerals take place, choosing instead to gather in the "living room". A plastic kid-sized skeleton kinda sends the wrong message. Think of the children.
 But Zoe certainly has learned a lot from having Mr. Thrifty around. She knew at a surprisingly young age that she was made of bone, muscle, and blood. She knew that her skeleton makes her able to stand, her muscles make her able to move, and her blood "goes all around" in her body bringing food to her muscles. But I wonder. Here it is: I wonder if on some level she also understands that she will end up like Mr. Thrifty ... bent, broken, powerless to move on her own?  

This lesson can probably wait. And anyway there's more to learn about us than just this. Mr. Thrifty can only teach so much. I want to teach my daughter that she is more than bones, that there is more than blood that "goes all around" inside her. 

Henry Vaughn in the fifteenth century wrote of one who 
> "Felt through all this fleshly dress > Bright shoots of everlastingness 

That's God to me, a bright shot of everlastingness. He is the one that "goes all around" in us, calling out to us from the deeps, from out of our bony prisons ... with an invitation to the dance.
  I have that to offer my daughter, that greater lesson to teach. But it's my selfish desire as well: I hope that when I begin to fail in the flesh, when my bones get brittle and bent, that deep will call out to deep and I will find myself, once again, in the arms of Zoe.
