Hi friends,

been a little bit since the last communication, during which I got covid, traveled to Greece, and made an unsuccessful attempt to follow in the footsteps of my Isolation antihero, Arpaxos, as he flees civilization for the wilderness of Greece. First a quick update on the pursuit of publication, then I'd like to offer a trip report as a superfan of my own character.

Publication Efforts:

I have managed to keep my hands off my stories for some time now, and the book is in a satisfying form for sharing. I'm taking advantage of some connections, through friends on this list and elsewhere, sharing the work, and essentially asking for help â€¦ help with knowing where to go from here, who else I might send it to, and what advice I might glean about the publication process.

One of these connections came via the serendipitous good fortune -- blessing -- of sharing my airline row with a gentleman who had a number of interesting connections: a chair of English and creative writing at Allegheny College, a poet and teacher of creative writing workshops in Greece, a lover of Mani and scholar of Patrick Leigh Fermor (see image for why THAT is relevant ... I was hoping to find Anghelika's father's copy of this book, one of the great travel books, beautifully written and important, and obviously pertinent.)

So this poor guy spent most of the flight trying to get on wifi in a panic because his flight had been delayed and he was desperate to sort out where he was going to go when he landed in Athens at 11 PM. I patiently waited for him to sort things out before engaging him about his business in Greece, and mine. We were able to exchange information, with the hopes that we'd pick up the conversation. I've emailed him a picture of the above book, because I wanted to report my success (in finding the book, if not in all my goals for Mani), and also because he took a keen interest in my description of Sloane's library -- he has done some work in archiving the libraries of English-speaking scholars in Greece. He also knew Angelika's family, as they are well-known in the English-speaking community Greece for their work in publishing. So, fun.

I continue to pray for God to illuminate my responsibility to this work, my journey to publication, to help me not be anxious about how others do it, but learn where I may, and always listen for God's gentle guidance, God's illumination of the light burden I am called to carry each day.
